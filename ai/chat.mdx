AI Chat provides instant assistance to users by answering questions, offering contextual help, and triggering interactive guides when needed. It's like having a product expert available 24/7 to help your users succeed.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understanding Your Application">
    When installed, Layup automatically analyzes your application's UI elements,
    navigation structure, and content to build a semantic understanding of your
    product.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Knowledge Enhancement">
    Connect your documentation, help center, or knowledge base to give the AI
    deeper context about your product's concepts, workflows, and best practices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contextual Responses">
    When users ask questions, AI Chat generates responses based on: - Current
    location in the app - User's history and preferences - Available UI elements
    and actions - Your knowledge base content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Assistance Decisions">
    For complex tasks, AI Chat can initiate [Interactive
    Guides](/ai/interactive-guides) that visually walk users through multi-step
    processes.
  </Step>
</Steps>
