Layup's AI platform is a comprehensive suite of intelligent features designed to enhance user experience, boost engagement, and reduce support burdens. Our platform uses advanced AI technologies to understand your application, anticipate user needs, and provide contextual assistance exactly when it's needed.

## Core Technology

At the heart of Layup's platform is our proprietary **Second Cursor** technology—an AI system that can:

1. **Understand your application** by analyzing UI elements and their relationships
2. **Interact with interfaces** to demonstrate tasks through guided visual interactions
3. **Generate contextual guidance** based on where users are and what they're trying to accomplish
4. **Learn from user behavior** to continuously improve assistance quality

## Integrated Features

Layup's AI Platform includes four key capabilities that work together to create a seamless user experience:
