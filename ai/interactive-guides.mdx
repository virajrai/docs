# Interactive Guides

Interactive Guides use Layup's Second Cursor technology to visually walk users through complex tasks with step-by-step assistance. By taking partial control of the interface, guides can demonstrate exactly how to accomplish tasks, eliminate confusion, and ensure successful outcomes.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Guide Initiation">
    Guides can be triggered by:
    
    - User questions in [AI Chat](/ai/chat)
    - Opening a guide from a link
    - Launching an [Announcement](/ai/announcements)
    - Scheduled [Onboarding](/ai/onboarding) flows

  </Step>
  <Step title="Task Analysis">
    The AI analyzes the requested task and breaks it down into logical steps,
    identifying the UI elements and interactions needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visual Demonstration">
    Layup's Second Cursor appears on screen and guides users through each step with:
    
    - Clear instructions
    - Element highlighting
    - Automated interactions
    - Contextual explanations
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Control">
    Users maintain control throughout the process:
    
    - Can pause, resume, or exit the guide at any time
    - May take over to complete actions themselves
    - Can request additional information during steps
  </Step>
</Steps>
