# Simple flows

Learn to create step-by-step, guided tours. 

## Overview

Simple flows are focused, step-by-step guided tours that walk users through specific features or tasks in your application.

Unlike comprehensive [onboarding flows](https://docs.layuplabs.ai/flows/composite-flow), simple flows tackle one specific goal—like creating a project, setting up a profile, or understanding a dashboard. They provide contextual guidance right when and where users need it.

## When to use simple flows

* **For new features:** Introduce users to functionality they haven't used before. Instead of hoping users discover new features, proactively show them how to use them.
* **For complex processes:** Guide users through multi-step workflows that might otherwise cause confusion. This reduces friction and increases completion rates for important tasks.
* **For converting free users:** Highlight premium functionality to free users with targeted tours. Show them what they're missing to encourage upgrades.
* **For contextual help:** Provide in-app assistance for specific tasks when users request it. This reduces support tickets and increases user confidence.

## How simple flows work

When a simple flow is triggered, it guides users through a series of steps:

1. **Highlighting:** The flow highlights a specific UI element on your page
2. **Instruction:** It displays contextual instructions for that element
3. **Action:** It waits for the user to complete the specified action (click, input, etc.)
4. **Progression:** After the action is completed, it automatically moves to the next step
5. **Completion:** When all steps are finished, the flow ends

This creates a guided, interactive experience that ensures users successfully complete each action before moving forward.

## Simple flow structure

### 1. Flow definition

First, define the flow itself with its basic properties:

```typescript
const featureTour = {
  id: "feature-tour",          // Unique identifier for your flow
  type: "simple",              // Specifies this is a simple flow
  name: "Feature tour",        // Name of the tour
  description: "Learn how to use our key features" // Optional description
};
```

The `id` is particularly important — it's how you'll reference this flow when triggering it manually.

### 2. Steps

Steps guide users through the feature. Each step highlights a specific element and provides instructions.

```typescript
steps: [
  {
    id: "create-project-step",   // Unique identifier for this step
    type: "guided",              // Step type: 'guided' | 'self-paced'
    position: "create-button",   // Element ID to highlight
    content: {
      description: "Click this button to create a project." // Description of the step
    }
	
  }
]
```

The `position` value should match the ID of an element in your application. Layup will find this element and highlight it during the tour.

The `type` can be either guided or self-paced:

* **Guided steps** automatically progress when the user completes the specified action.
* **Self-paced steps** give users more control over their progress. They are typically used for documentation-style guides or tips.

<Note>
  Note: When configuring a step, you'll see more props available. However, those are only used when creating a composite flow. Any other props added when creating a simple flow will not be visible.
</Note>

### 3. Actions

Actions make your flow interactive, defining what the user needs to do to proceed to the next step.

```typescript
{
  id: "create-project-step",
  type: "guided",
  position: "create-button",
  content: {
    description: "Click this button to create a new project."
  },
  action: {
    type: "click" // Wait for user to click before proceeding
  }
}
```

Supported action types are:

* `click` — wait for the user to click the highlighted element
* `input` — wait for the user to type in a form field

## Creating page-specific flows

Often, you'll want flows to appear only on specific pages. You can achieve this by adding a `page` property:

```typescript
const profileTour = {
  id: "profile-tour",
  type: "simple",
  name: "Profile setup",
  page: "/profile",          // This flow will only activate on the profile page
  steps: [
    // Steps specific to the profile page
  ]
};
```

The flow will only activate when the user is on the specified page, ensuring contextual relevance.

## Creating cross-page flows

Sometimes you need to guide users across multiple pages of your application. This is possible by specifying different pages for individual steps and using navigate actions.

```typescript
steps: [
  // Step on the dashboard page
  {
    id: "find-profile",
    type: "guided",
    position: "profile-link",
    page: "/dashboard",      // This step appears on the dashboard page
    content: {
      description: "Click here to navigate to your profile settings."
    },
    action: { type: "click" }
  },
  
  // Next step on the profile page
  {
    id: "edit-avatar",
    type: "guided",
    position: "avatar-upload",
    page: "/profile",        // This step appears on the profile page
    content: {
      description: "Upload a profile picture by clicking here."
    },
    action: { type: "click" }
  }
]
```

Layup automatically handles the page transitions, waiting for the new page to load before continuing the flow.

<Note>
  Note: for cross-page flows, we recommend setting up a [composite flow](https://docs.layuplabs.ai/flows/composite-flow). Simple flows are ideal for quick, single page flows.
</Note>

## Creating external link flows

Not all guidance needs to happen within your app. You can create flows that direct users to external resources like documentation. This creates a simple flow with just a button that opens the specified URL. These are only available in [composite flows](https://docs.layuplabs.ai/flows/composite-flow).

## Triggering simple flows

You can trigger flows using the `useFlow` hook. Check out the Triggers page for more info.

## Complete example

Here's a complete example of a simple flow for introducing users to a dashboard:

```typescript
const dashboardTour = {
  id: "dashboard-tour",
  type: "simple",
  name: "Dashboard intro",
  page: "/dashboard",
  
  steps: [
    // Show metrics panel
    {
      id: "metrics-step",
      type: "guided",
      position: "metrics-panel",
      content: {
        description: "Here you can see key metrics about your account activity and progress."
      },
      action: { type: "click" }
    },
    // Create a project
    {
      id: "create-project-step",
      type: "guided",
      position: "create-project-button",
      content: {
        description: "Let's create your first project. Click this button to get started."
      },
      action: { type: "click" }
    }
  ]
};
```

## Best practices

* **Focus on one goal** per flow. Each flow should help users accomplish a specific task.
* **Keep instructions concise**. Tell users exactly what to do in as few words as possible.
* **Explain the "why"** not just the "what." Help users understand why each step matters.
* **Test on multiple devices** to ensure your flows work well on different screen sizes.
* **Validate user actions** to ensure users successfully complete each step before moving forward.
* **Consider keyboard navigation** for users who don't use a mouse.
* **Avoid blocking critical UI** elements with your flow tooltips.
