# Composite flows

Learn to create onboarding experiences with welcome screens and checklists.

## Overview

Composite flows are comprehensive onboarding experiences that guide new users through your product. Unlike simple flows that focus on a single feature, composite flows combine a welcome screen, multiple guided tours, and a progress checklist to create a complete product introduction.

These flows provide a structured yet flexible way for users to learn your product, allowing them to explore features at their own pace while ensuring they discover all key functionality.

## When to use composite flows

* **For new user onboarding:** Create a guided introduction to your product that helps users get started quickly. This improves activation rates by ensuring users discover key features from day one.
* **For major releases:** Introduce existing users to multiple new features after a significant update. This increases feature adoption by highlighting what's new.
* **For trial-to-paid conversion:** Guide trial users through your product's most valuable features before their trial expires. This improves conversion rates by showcasing your product's full value.
* **For user re-engagement:** Welcome back dormant users with a refresher on key features and introduction to what's new. This helps reactivate users who haven't logged in recently.

## How composite flows work

When a composite flow is triggered, users experience:

1. **Welcome screen:** First, a welcome modal appears with a friendly introduction to the onboarding experience
2. **Checklist display:** After clicking the welcome button, a checklist appears showing all available tours
3. **Self-directed exploration:** Users can choose which features to explore in any order
4. **Progress tracking:** The checklist shows which tours have been completed
5. **Completion:** When all tours are finished, the onboarding experience is complete

This creates a guided yet self-paced learning experience that respects users' preferences while ensuring feature discovery.

## Composite flow structure

### 1. Flow definition

First, define the flow itself with its basic properties:

```typescript
const onboardingFlow = {
  id: "new-user-onboarding",    // Unique identifier
  type: "composite",            // Specifies this as a composite flow
  name: "New user onboarding",  // Display name
  description: "Welcome to our platform!" // Optional description
};
```

### 2. Welcome modal

The welcome modal introduces users to your product and sets expectations for the onboarding:

```typescript
welcome: {
  title: "Hey there ðŸ‘‹",                // Main headline
  subtitle: "Welcome to Layup!",   // Subheading
  description: "Let's take a quick, interactive tour of our platform.", // Detailed description
  image: {
    light: "/welcome-image-light.svg",  // Image shown in light mode
    dark: "/welcome-image-dark.svg"     // Image shown in dark mode
  },
  buttonText: "Take a tour",           // Call-to-action button text
}
```

### 3. Subflows

Subflows are the individual guided tours that make up your onboarding experience. Each subflow can be either:

**Guided tour subflows** â€” Step-by-step walkthroughs of specific features:

```typescript
subflows: [
  {
    id: "dashboard-tour",
    type: "simple",
    name: "Explore the dashboard",
    description: "Learn about your dashboard",
    page: "/dashboard",
    buttonText: "Start tour",
    allowRetrigger: true, // Optional: allow users to retake the tour
    steps: [
      {
        id: "dashboard-overview",
        type: "guided", // or "self-paced"
        position: "dashboard-header",
        content: {
          description: "This is your main dashboard.",
        },
        action: { type: "click" }, // Optional interaction
        showCloseButton: true // Optional close button
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Button-link subflows** â€” Direct links to external resources like documentation:

```typescript
{
  id: "documentation",
  type: "simple",
  name: "View docs",
  description: "Check out our documentation",
  buttonText: "View docs",
  buttonLink: "https://docs.layuplabs.ai" // External URL
}
```

### 4. Checklist configuration

The checklist helps users track their progress through the onboarding experience:

```typescript
checklistConfig: {
  header: "Getting started ðŸ‘‹",
  position: "right", // "left", "right", "top", "bottom", "top-start", "top-end", "bottom-start", "bottom-end"
  triggerId: "show-checklist", // Optional element ID to trigger checklist
  offset: 10, // Optional offset, if using a triggerId
  minimizable: true,
}
```

By default, checklists appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen:

For more control over the checklist's position, you can use a manual trigger. This is especially useful when you want to integrate the checklist with your UI (e.g., in a sidebar) and create a more native feel. Check out how [Knowt](https://knowt.com) (ed-tech, 3.5+ million users) customizes the checklist:

## Using cross-page flows

Composite flows can guide users across multiple pages of your application. When a subflow's page property differs from the current page, Layup will:

1. Navigate the user to the specified page
2. Wait for the page to load
3. Start the guided tour on the new page

This creates a seamless onboarding experience that spans your entire application.

## Triggering composite flows

Like simple flows, composite flows can be triggered via the `useFlow` hook. See our [Triggers](https://docs.layuplabs.ai/flows/triggers) page for details.

## Complete example

Here's a complete example of a composite flow for onboarding new users:

```typescript
const onboardingFlow = {
  id: "new-user-onboarding",
  type: "composite",
  name: "New user onboarding",
  
  // Welcome modal
  welcome: {
    title: "Hey there ðŸ‘‹",        
    subtitle: "Welcome to Layup!",
    description: "Let's take a quick, interactive tour of our platform.",
    image: "/welcome-image.svg",     
    buttonText: "Take a tour",          
  }
  
  // Subflows
  subflows: [
    // Dashboard tour
    {
      id: "dashboard-tour",
      type: "simple",
      name: "Explore the dashboard",
      description: "Learn how to navigate your dashboard",
      page: "/dashboard",
      buttonText: "Explore dashboard",
      steps: [
        {
          id: "dashboard-overview",
          type: "self-paced" // for informational steps; for action steps, use 'guided'
          position: "dashboard-header",
          content: {
            description: "This is your main dashboard where you can see all your projects and activities."
          }
        },
        {
          id: "metrics-panel",
          type: "guided",
          position: "metrics-panel",
          content: {
            description: "Here you can track your project metrics and performance."
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    
    // Documentation link
    {
      id: "documentation",
      type: "simple",
      name: "View docs",
      description: "Check out our documentation.",
      buttonText: "View docs",
      buttonLink: "https://docs.layuplabs.ai"
    }
  ],

  // Checklist configuration
  showChecklist: true,               
  checklistConfig: {
    header: "Getting started ðŸ‘‹", 
    position: "right",            
    minimizable: true,  
  }
};
```

## Best practices

* **Limit the number of subflows:** Keep your onboarding focused by including only 3-5 essential tours. Too many options can overwhelm users.
* **Order subflows logically:** Arrange tours in a natural progression, with foundational features first and advanced features later.
* **Make descriptions clear:** Each subflow should have a concise description explaining what users will learn.
* **Use visual cues:** Include images in your welcome modal to make it engaging and set expectations.
* **Allow skipping:** Don't force users to complete every tour; let them pick what's relevant to them.
* **Consider user segments:** Create different onboarding flows for different user types or roles.
* **Test thoroughly:** Verify your composite flow works across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes.
