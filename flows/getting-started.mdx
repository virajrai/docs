# Getting started

Learn how to set up interactive onboarding and guided product tours.

## Overview

Interactive flows help users discover and learn your product through step-by-step guidance. Unlike our AI chat and interactive guides, flows require explicit configuration from developers, giving you precise control over the user experience.

With Layup's flows, you can:

- Onboard new users with guided tours of your product
- Highlight new features or important functionality
- Guide users through complex workflows
- Increase feature adoption and user engagement
- Reduce support tickets by proactively educating users

Flows are fully customizable and can be triggered automatically (when a user visits a specific page or meets certain conditions) or manually (when a user clicks a button).

We're giving flows their own section because they require additional configuration and are designed for specific scenarios\\\\!

<Note>
  Note: We're working on a visual editor and browser extension to make flow
  creation even easier. For now, flows are configured through code, giving you
  more flexibility.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab an API key from the Layup dashboard.">
    Login to the [Layup dashboard](https://app.layuplabs.ai), then create a project. Two keys will be automatically generated for you — a production and development key. Copy the development key and store it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Layup SDK using your preferred package manager.">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm install layup-js
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm add layup-js
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add layup-js
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment variables.">
    Add the appropriate Layup API key into your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    LAYUP_API_KEY=lp_dev_*********************
    ```

    <Note>
      Note that there are two types of API keys: development and production.

      * **Development keys** (`lp_dev_*`):
        * For local development only
        * No origin restrictions
        * Stricter rate limits
      * **Production keys** (`lp_live_*`):
        * Required for deployed applications
        * Must specify allowed origin domains
        * Domains must be valid (e.g., example.com)
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the provider">
    Add the `LayupFlowProvider` to wrap your app, typically in a layout file that contains your authenticated routes:

    ```typescript
    import { LayupFlowProvider } from "layup-js";

    function App() {
    	return (
    		<LayupFlowProvider
      		 apiKey={process.env.LAYUP_API_KEY!}
             flows={myFlows}
            >
      		  {children}
    		</LayupFlowProvider>
    	);
    }
    ```

    See more info below on configuring the `LayupFlowProvider`.

  </Step>
</Steps>
